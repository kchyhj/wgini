# wgini — Weighted Gini coefficient with Lerman–Yitzhaki source decomposition

`wgini` is a Stata command that computes the Gini coefficient under sampling
or population weights and, optionally, decomposes it additively by income or
asset **source** (Lerman & Yitzhaki 1985) or by **observation**. It exists
because the standard tools cover only parts of this:

| | weights | LY source decomposition | observation-level contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `descogini` (López-Feldman 2006, *Stata Journal*) | **no** (`weights not allowed`) | yes | no |
| `ineqrbd` (Jenkins) | yes | no — regression-based (Fields/Shorrocks) CV decomposition, a different method | no |
| `wgini` | yes | yes | yes |

Survey microdata (CPS, LIS, SHFLC, EU-SILC, …) require weights, which is what
motivated this command.

## Installation

```stata
net install wgini, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kchyhj/wgini/main/")
```

or copy `wgini.ado` and `wgini.sthlp` into your personal ado directory
(`adopath` shows where). Requires Stata 14 or later. After installing, see
`help wgini`.

## Quick start

**1. Weighted Gini of one variable.** Computes the Gini of `networth` with
the survey weight applied, and leaves `r(gini)`, `r(N)`, and `r(mean)`
behind for later use.

```stata
wgini networth [aw=weight]
```

**2. Gini computed by subgroup.** `wgini` itself computes one number for
the sample it is given; to get one Gini *per subgroup* (here, per year ×
age group), wrap it in Stata's `statsby`, which runs the command once for
every subgroup and collects the returned results into a new dataset with
one row per subgroup.

```stata
statsby gini=r(gini) n=r(N), by(year agegrp) clear: ///
    wgini networth [aw=weight]
list year agegrp gini n
```

(Note that `statsby ..., clear` replaces the data in memory with the
collected results — save your data first.)

> **Caveat — the Gini does not decompose by subgroup.** This pattern
> *computes* a separate Gini within each subgroup; it does not *decompose*
> the overall Gini into those subgroups. The asymmetry is visible in the
> covariance form itself. Write the Gini as

> $$G \;=\; \frac{2\,\mathrm{cov}_w\!\big(x,\,F(x)\big)}{\mu}.$$
>
> **Sources** enter through the *first* argument of the covariance. If
> $x = \sum_k y_k$, then because the covariance is linear in its first

> *total* — stay fixed,
>
> $$\mathrm{cov}_w\!\Big(\textstyle\sum_k y_k,\,F(x)\Big)
> = \sum_k \mathrm{cov}_w\big(y_k,\,F(x)\big)
> \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
> G = \sum_k \frac{2\,\mathrm{cov}_w\big(y_k,\,F(x)\big)}{\mu},$$
>

> (e.g. Theil) instead, for example with `ineqdeco` (Jenkins, SSC).

**3. Source decomposition.** When net worth is the sum of asset components
(here housing + other real estate + vehicles + savings + debt entered as a
*negative* variable, e.g. `gen negdebt = -debt`), this splits the Gini into
one additive contribution per component and factors each into
share × own Gini × Gini correlation:

```stata
wgini networth [aw=weight], source(home other_re vehicles saving negdebt)
matrix list r(decomp)     // contrib share Sk Gk Rk, one row per source
```

**4. Observation-level contributions — who drives the Gini?** This
answers questions like: *how much of measured inequality comes from the
top 1% of earners?* `gi(gcon)` creates a new variable `gcon` holding each
observation's own additive contribution to the Gini. The contributions
sum exactly to `r(gini)`, so summing `gcon` over any set of observations
and dividing by the Gini gives that set's share of overall inequality.

```stata
* share of the Gini attributable to the top 1% of earners
wgini income [aw=weight], gi(gcon) noprint
scalar G = r(gini)                    // keep the Gini for later division
_pctile income [aw=weight], p(99)     // weighted 99th percentile cutoff
quietly sum gcon if income > r(r1)    // add up the top 1%'s contributions
display "top 1% share of the Gini = " %5.3f r(sum)/G
```

The same logic works for a single unit. Here `gsort -networth` sorts in
*descending* order of net worth (the minus sign), so observation 1 is the
richest household, and `in 1` restricts `list` to that first row:

```stata
wgini networth [aw=weight], gi(gcon) noprint
scalar G = r(gini)
gsort -networth
display gcon[1]/G            // the richest household's share of the Gini
list networth gcon in 1
```

In one application to a national wealth survey, the single richest
household among 20-something householders held 12% of the group's assets
and accounted for 17% of the group's Gini — exactly the kind of fragility
this diagnostic is for. Note that contributions are positive in *both*
tails: for the rich, $(x_i-\mu)>0$ and $(F_i-\tfrac12)>0$; for the poor,
both factors are negative. Observations near the middle contribute
roughly zero.

**5. Recomputing the Gini without the top unit(s).** The contribution in
`gcon` describes the role of an observation *within the current sample*;
it is **not** what the Gini would fall by if you deleted that observation,
because deleting it changes the mean and every rank. To get the Gini
*without* some units, rerun `wgini` on the restricted sample with `if`:

```stata
* without the single largest household
quietly sum networth
wgini networth if networth < r(max) [aw=weight]

* without the top 1% (weighted 99th-percentile cutoff)
_pctile networth [aw=weight], p(99)
wgini networth if networth <= r(r1) [aw=weight]
```

(If several households tie exactly at the maximum, the first `if` drops all
of them; with continuous wealth data that is rarely an issue. To pin down
one specific household, condition on its id instead:
`wgini networth if hhid != "<top id>" [aw=weight]`.)

## Method

The Gini is computed in the Lerman–Yitzhaki (1984) covariance form

```
G = 2 cov_w(x, F) / mu
```

where `F` is the weighted fractional rank and `mu` the weighted mean. With
`source(y1 ... yK)` and `x = y1 + ... + yK`, linearity of the covariance gives
an exact additive decomposition,

```
G = sum_k 2 cov_w(y_k, F) / mu = sum_k S_k * G_k * R_k
```

with `S_k` the source's share of the total, `G_k` the source's own Gini, and
`R_k` its Gini correlation with the rank of the total (Lerman & Yitzhaki
1985; Stark, Taylor & Yitzhaki 1986). The identity `sum_k contrib_k = G` is
returned as a check (`r(sumdev)`); in the test suite it holds to ~1e-16.

**Negative values are allowed throughout — a property of the
Lerman–Yitzhaki form.** Textbook constructions of the Gini (the Lorenz
curve, or the mean of absolute differences divided by twice the mean)
implicitly assume nonnegative values. The covariance form does not: it
needs only each observation's deviation from the mean, $x_i - \mu$, and
its fractional rank, $F(x_i)$, both of which are perfectly well defined
for negative values. The only requirement is a positive mean, $\mu > 0$.
So a variable like net worth, where indebted households are negative, is
computed as-is — no truncation at zero, no dropping of negative
observations. One consequence to be aware of: with negative values the
Gini is no longer bounded by 1 and can exceed it (documented, not an
error). Likewise a source with a negative mean (enter debt as `-debt`)
has negative `S_k`, `G_k`, `R_k` whose product is still its correct
negative contribution. No absolute values are taken anywhere.

### Ties and reproducibility

Tied values receive the **mid-rank** of their tie group. This matters more
than it sounds: Stata's `sort` orders tied observations randomly, and while
the total Gini is provably invariant to that order, source contributions and
observation-level contributions are not — with arbitrary tie ranks they change
from run to run (in our survey application, by up to ~1e-4 in small groups
with many zero-wealth ties). Mid-ranking makes the decomposition well defined
and exactly reproducible: same data in, bit-identical results out. `wgini`
also restores the sort order of your data before exiting.

## Validation

The test suite (`test/wgini_test.do`, self-contained synthetic data) checks:

1. **Identity**: source contributions sum to the Gini (~1e-16).
2. **Factorization**: `contrib_k = S_k * G_k * R_k` holds row by row,
   including for a negative-mean (debt) source.
3. **Against `descogini`**: with all weights equal to 1 — the only case
   `descogini` accepts — `wgini` reproduces its `Sk`, `Gk`, `Rk`, and share
   columns to four decimals. (On a national wealth survey with 18,664
   households and six sources the match was exact to four decimals in every
   cell.) With actual weights the two commands are not comparable, since
   `descogini` refuses weights.
4. **Tie invariance**: permuting the physical order of tied observations
   leaves every result unchanged.
5. **Reproducibility**: two runs on the same data return bit-identical
   `r(decomp)`.
6. **Sort restoration**: the command does not change the order of your data.
7. **Error handling**: sources that do not sum to the total are rejected
   (r 459); an all-zero source gets contribution 0 with `G_k`, `R_k` missing.
